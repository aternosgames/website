                    <p>We want to create a completely new Minecraft minigame experience. To achieve this, we are reconsidering all basic concepts of existing minigame networks. These are our main approaches:</p>

                            <p>We want to treat every player the same. There is no possibility to pay for anything, no paid ranks, no paid cosmetics and no paid loot boxes.</p>

                            <p>We want to give everyone the ability to participate in creating a healthy community. Everybody can help to moderate the network and collectively punish bad behaviour.</p>

                    <h1>How?</h1>
                    <p>Aternos is running entirely free Minecraft servers for more than 5 years funded by ads. It is now one of the biggest hosting providers in the world with more than 7 million registered users and more than 800,000 players every month. Aternos hosting power is able to run more than 5,000 Minecraft servers at the same time. This technical and financial power provides Aternos Games with the foundation it needs to start one of the biggest Minecraft minigame networks in the world. Later on, we want to cover the expenses through ads with the knowledge and experience that weâ€™ve gained through running a successful ad-funded company for years.</p>
