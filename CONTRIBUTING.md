# Contributing guidelines for the Aternos Games website

## Coding style
### HTML
### (S)CSS
- Prefer  classes over ids, even if the styling might only apply to one item
- Try to nest maximum 3 layers deep if possible
- Aggregate multiple selectors that are from the same type, for example h1-h6, in one line
- Stack multiple selectors from different types, for example div.comment and article, in multiple lines - one line each
- Opening brackets start in the same line behind the identifier
### JS/TS
### Vue
